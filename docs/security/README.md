## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities Resolved

### Critical Issues (Fixed in TASK-005)

1. **Missing Rate Limiting** ✅
   - Implemented rate limiting on all OAuth endpoints
   - 10 requests per 15 minutes limit
   - Proper error responses with retry-after headers

2. **User-Controlled Bypass of Security Check** ✅
   - Strict validation of authorization codes
   - Format validation with regex patterns
   - Length limits and type checking

3. **Weak State Parameter/CSRF Protection** ✅
   - HMAC-SHA256 signed state parameters
   - Cryptographically secure nonce generation
   - Timestamp-based expiration validation

4. **Reverse Tabnabbing** ✅
   - Secure window.open with noopener,noreferrer
   - Proper external link handling

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

### Immediate Response (0-1 hour)

1. Assess impact of security issue
2. Disable affected endpoints if necessary
3. Notify security team immediately
4. Document initial findings

### Short-term Response (1-24 hours)

1. Implement temporary fix if possible
2. Notify stakeholders of issue
3. Begin investigation of root cause
4. Update monitoring for similar issues

### Long-term Response (1-7 days)

1. Implement permanent fix
2. Test fix thoroughly
3. Deploy fix with monitoring
4. Update security documentation
5. Conduct post-incident review

## 🧪 Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- Unit tests for security functions
- Integration tests for OAuth flows
- Security test suite with Vitest
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Manual Testing

- Rate limiting validation
