# TASK-011 - REMAINING SECURITY TEST ISSUES

## STATUS: 8/19 PASSING (42% IMPROVEMENT) üü°

### TESTS PASSING ‚úÖ (8)
1. Authentication Security (3/3) ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ should reject requests without authentication
   - ‚úÖ should reject requests with invalid token
   - ‚úÖ should reject requests with malformed authorization header

2. Data Isolation Security (1/4) ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ should not allow user to access other user's transactions

3. Input Validation Security (4/7) ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ should reject NoSQL injection attempts
   - ‚úÖ should reject extremely large payloads
   - ‚úÖ should reject negative amounts
   - ‚úÖ should reject invalid date formats

### TESTS FAILING ‚ùå (11)

## 1. DATA ISOLATION SECURITY (3 failing)

### Problem Analysis
The tests are expecting 404 (not found) but receiving 400 (bad request). This indicates that:
- Fastify's schema validation is happening BEFORE the business logic
- The request is failing validation before reaching the service layer
- The tests are using valid ObjectIds, but they're being rejected at the schema level

### Tests Failing:
- ‚ùå `should not allow user to access other user's transaction by ID` (expecting 404, getting 400)
- ‚ùå `should not allow user to update other user's transaction` (expecting 404, getting 400)
- ‚ùå `should not allow user to delete other user's transaction` (expecting 404, getting 400)

### Root Cause
The issue is that the tests expect the API to:
1. Accept the request with valid authentication (other user's token)
2. Process the request through the service layer
3. Return 404 when the transaction is not found for that user

But currently:
1. The request is being validated by Fastify's schema
2. Validation fails with 400 before reaching the service layer
3. The service layer never gets a chance to return 404

### Solution Required
- Modify the transaction service methods to:
  - Filter all queries by `userId` from the authenticated user
  - Return `null` when a transaction is not found for that user
  - Let the route handler convert `null` to 404 response
- Ensure the schema validation passes for valid ObjectIds
- Ensure the service layer handles the authorization logic

---

## 2. INPUT VALIDATION SECURITY (2 failing)

### Tests Failing:
- ‚ùå `should reject SQL injection attempts` (expecting 200, getting 400)
- ‚ùå `should reject XSS attempts in transaction description` (expecting 201, getting 400)

### Problem Analysis

#### SQL Injection Test
- **Expected**: 200 (empty results, SQL injection should be sanitized and ignored)
- **Actual**: 400 (bad request)
- **Root Cause**: The input sanitization middleware is being too aggressive and modifying the search parameter in a way that breaks the schema validation
- **Solution**: Ensure the input sanitization middleware only cleans dangerous patterns without breaking valid queries

#### XSS Test
- **Expected**: 201 (created with sanitized description)
- **Actual**: 400 (bad request)
- **Root Cause**: The XSS sanitization is modifying the description in a way that breaks the schema validation (possibly removing all content or making it too short)
- **Solution**: Adjust the sanitization to preserve valid content while removing XSS payloads

---

## 3. RATE LIMITING SECURITY (2 failing)

### Tests Failing:
- ‚ùå `should enforce rate limiting on transaction creation` (expecting rate-limited, getting normal)
- ‚ùå `should enforce rate limiting on transaction queries` (expecting rate-limited, getting normal)

### Problem Analysis
- **Root Cause**: The `rateLimiterMiddleware` is currently a placeholder with no actual rate limiting logic
- **Expected**: After 50 rapid requests, some should receive 429 (Too Many Requests)
- **Actual**: All requests are passing through without rate limiting

### Solution Required
- Implement actual rate limiting logic in the middleware
- Use `@fastify/rate-limit` plugin or custom implementation
- Configure appropriate limits (e.g., 20 requests per minute per IP/user)
- Ensure rate limiting is applied per user/IP, not globally

---

## 4. DATA SANITIZATION SECURITY (2 failing)

### Tests Failing:
- ‚ùå `should sanitize transaction metadata` (expecting 201, getting 400)
- ‚ùå `should sanitize transaction tags` (expecting 201, getting 400)

### Problem Analysis
- **Expected**: 201 (created with sanitized metadata/tags)
- **Actual**: 400 (bad request)
- **Root Cause**: The sanitization is modifying the data in a way that breaks the schema validation
  - Tags: Sanitization might be removing characters that are part of valid tags
  - Metadata: Sanitization might be modifying URLs or other valid metadata fields

### Example from tests:
```javascript
// Test expects these to be sanitized but still pass validation:
tags: ['safe', '<script>alert("tag xss")</script>', 'sql;DROP TABLE users;']
metadata: {
  location: 'Safe Location',
  notes: '<script>alert("metadata xss")</script>',
  attachments: ['http://evil.com/malicious.js']
}
```

### Solution Required
- Adjust the sanitization logic to:
  - Remove XSS payloads but preserve valid content
  - Handle URLs properly (don't sanitize valid URLs)
  - Ensure sanitized data still passes schema validation
- Consider using a more permissive XSS filter or adjusting the schema

## 5. AUTHORIZATION BYPASS SECURITY (2 failing)

### Tests Failing:
- ‚ùå `should not allow access to transactions with invalid user context` (expecting 401, getting 200)
- ‚ùå `should not allow access to transactions with empty user context` (expecting 401, getting 200)

### Problem Analysis
- **Expected**: 401 (unauthorized) when using invalid or empty user ID
- **Actual**: 200 (success) - the requests are passing through
- **Root Cause**: The authorization middleware is validating the user context, but these specific edge cases are passing through

### Test Details:
```javascript
// Test 1: Invalid user ID
authorization: `Bearer ${jwt.sign({ userId: 'invalid-id', type: 'access' }, process.env.JWT_SECRET)}`

// Test 2: Empty user ID
authorization: `Bearer ${jwt.sign({ userId: '', type: 'access' }, process.env.JWT_SECRET)}`
```

### Solution Required
- Strengthen the authorization middleware validation:
  - Check for invalid MongoDB ObjectId format (currently checking, but may not be working)
  - Check for empty string user ID (currently checking, but may not be working)
- Verify the middleware is being executed for these requests
- Debug why these validations are passing when they shouldn't

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Security Issues)
1. **Authorization Bypass** (2 tests) - These are critical security vulnerabilities
   - Users with invalid/empty IDs can access data
   - Highest security risk

2. **Data Isolation** (3 tests) - Security issue, but less critical
   - Tests are failing due to schema validation, not actual security issue
   - Need to refactor service layer to handle authorization

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Security Features)
3. **Rate Limiting** (2 tests) - Important security feature
   - Currently no rate limiting at all
   - Need to implement full middleware

4. **Data Sanitization** (2 tests) - Security feature
   - Sanitization is working but too aggressive
   - Need to fine-tune to balance security and usability

### LOW PRIORITY (Edge Case)
5. **Input Validation** (2 tests) - Edge case handling
   - Sanitization is working but breaking some tests
   - Need to adjust sanitization logic
