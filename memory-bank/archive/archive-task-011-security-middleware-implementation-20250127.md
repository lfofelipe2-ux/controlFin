## IMPLEMENTATION

### **Approach**
The implementation followed a systematic problem-solving approach, methodically identifying and addressing each of the 10 critical security issues. The approach prioritized the most critical vulnerabilities first (data isolation, authorization bypass) while maintaining system stability throughout the process.

### **Key Components**

#### **1. Input Sanitization Middleware** (`src/middlewares/input-sanitizer.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- **Features**:
  - Script tag removal and sanitization
  - Template literal sanitization for `${...}` patterns
  - NoSQL injection pattern detection
  - Safe handling of null-prototype objects
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious content from reaching the application

#### **2. Rate Limiting Middleware** (`src/middlewares/rate-limiter.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Implement configurable rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Features**:
  - Environment-based configuration (disabled in test mode)
  - Configurable rate limits via environment variables
  - Test mode support for reliable testing
- **Impact**: Prevents API abuse and ensures fair resource usage

#### **3. Authentication Middleware** (`src/middlewares/auth.middleware.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Verify JWT tokens and establish user context
- **Features**:
  - JWT token validation
  - User context establishment
  - Authorization checks
- **Impact**: Ensures only authenticated users can access protected resources

#### **4. Authorization Middleware** (`src/middlewares/authorization.middleware.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Validate user permissions and prevent unauthorized access
- **Features**:
  - User context validation
  - Permission checks
  - Data isolation enforcement
- **Impact**: Prevents users from accessing other users' data

#### **5. Data Sanitizer Utility** (`src/utils/data-sanitizer.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Sanitize data before storage or transmission
- **Features**:
  - Deep object sanitization
  - Safe handling of various data types
  - Template literal protection
- **Impact**: Ensures data integrity and prevents data corruption

#### **6. User Context Validator** (`src/utils/user-context-validator.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Validate and manage user context throughout requests
- **Features**:
  - User context validation
  - Permission verification
  - Data access control
- **Impact**: Ensures proper user context for all operations

### **Files Changed**

#### **New Files Created**
- `src/middlewares/input-sanitizer.ts` - Input sanitization middleware
- `src/middlewares/rate-limiter.ts` - Rate limiting middleware
- `src/middlewares/authorization.middleware.ts` - Authorization middleware
- `src/utils/data-sanitizer.ts` - Data sanitization utility
- `src/utils/user-context-validator.ts` - User context validator

#### **Modified Files**
- `src/server.ts` - Added global middleware registration
- `src/modules/transactions/transaction.routes.ts` - Updated with security middleware
- `src/modules/transactions/transaction.service.ts` - Enhanced with security checks
- `tests/test-env.ts` - Updated test environment configuration
- `tests/security/transaction-security.test.ts` - Enhanced security test suite

### **Architecture Decisions**

#### **1. Global Middleware Application**
- **Decision**: Apply security middleware globally to all routes except `/api/auth`
- **Rationale**: Ensures comprehensive security coverage across the entire application
- **Implementation**: Used Fastify's `preHandler` hooks for global application

#### **2. Environment-Based Configuration**
- **Decision**: Use environment variables to control middleware behavior
- **Rationale**: Allows different configurations for test, development, and production
- **Implementation**: Environment variables control rate limiting and other security features

#### **3. Layered Security Approach**
- **Decision**: Implement multiple layers of security (input sanitization, authentication, authorization)
- **Rationale**: Defense in depth provides better security than single-layer protection
- **Implementation**: Multiple middleware components working together

#### **4. Test-Friendly Design**
- **Decision**: Design middleware to be easily testable and configurable
- **Rationale**: Ensures security features can be properly tested without breaking tests
- **Implementation**: Test mode configurations and comprehensive test coverage
